# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks
This repository contains all the code that was used to complete the projects for QBS181. It is meant to display the work we did during this class!

## QBS181 Projects: I have been given permission to make my work public.

## project1
Project 1 contains the code for the first homework where we were assigned to complete series of tasks, ranging from renaming columns to creating new columns and intervals.

## project2
Project 2 contains the code for the second homework where we updated the PhoneCall table. We created a new column, merged multiple tables together, and visualize trends within the data (namely the counts of texts for each chronic condition over a period of time)

## midterm_project
Midterm contains the code for the midterm where we were assigned to completely clean up and analyze some national health data.

## final_project
Final contains the SQL and R code for the Final Exam to manipulate the IC_BP dataset in multiple different ways. We merged tables, estimated blood pressure scores and counted the number of patients whose blood pressure improved over a unique interval for each patient.
